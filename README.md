# recursion

Project to practice using recursion.
Examples used will be Fibonacci and Merge Sort.

Merge Sort:

- In merge sort the idea of the algorithm is to sort smaller arrays and then combine(merge) those arrays into sorted order.
- In pseudocode this would look like:
  1. Sort the left half of array (assuming n > 1)
  2. Sort the right half of the arry (assuming n > 1)
  3. Merge the two halves together
